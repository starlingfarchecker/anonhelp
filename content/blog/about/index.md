## What is AnonHelp

AnonHelp is a directory for therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental
health workers who are willing to receive the cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) as
payment for their services. AnonHelp aims to connect mental health providers
directly to people in need of mental help in a direct, peer-to-peer, anonymous, and private
way. AnonHelp is merely a directory; we never collect platform fees of any kind. 

We do not require KYC (Know Your Customer) for both the mental health provider
or for those seeking help. Mental health providers listed have their credentials
vetted without having to reveal their identity

Anonymous XMR donations for AnonHelp are much appreciated. 100% of funds go to those who are
unable to pay for help.

## How it works from the client's side

To specify which kind of help you require, take a look at the
[tags](https://anonhelp.pages.dev/tags) page. There, you can choose a
provider which seems right for you. There will be means to contact them directly
in their page, usually through a private messaging app like SimpleX, Telegram,
Session or Signal. From there, you can set up a date, time, and means of video or
audio conferencing (I recommend [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/)). During the
meeting, you can negotiate and agree on an XMR price for the session and pay
each other directly.

## How it works from the provider's side
