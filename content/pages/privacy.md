If personal data can be entered (for example: name, address, or email addresses), this is on a voluntary basis.

### SSL encryption
This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of sensitive content, such as the requests you send to me.
An encrypted connection can be recognized by the fact that the address in the address bar of the browser starts with `https://` and a lock symbol nearby.
If SSL encryption is enabled, the data you submit to me can not be read by third parties.
